# Object-Oriented-Implementation-of-Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI-Integration

This project demonstrates how to develop and use a Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python by utilizing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and including AI elements, focusing on modularity, efficiency, and interactive gameplay. The game features an unbeatable AI opponent implemented by the Minimax algorithm, ensuring that the AI always makes optimal moves to win, offering a challenging experience for the human player as the worst-case scenario would always be a tie and never a human win. Core OOP principles like encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism are applied throughout the project to ensure clear structure and functionality and hence emphasizing the the OOP’s bebefits. Encapsulation is used to manage entire game logic using individual classes, while abstraction hides the complexities of tasks such as board rendering, move validation, and AI decision-making from the user. Inheritance allows shared behavior between human and AI players, while polymorphism ensures flexibility by enabling different implementations of the move-making process for each player type. Key components include the `Renderer` class for visualizing the game board with Pygame, the `Logger` class to record each move in a text file, and the `Minimax_AI` class, which uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible move for the AI. The game’s structure is modular, with each class encapsulating specific functionality, ensuring that the program remains scalable and maintainable. This project showcases the power of combining algorithmic logic, like the Minimax algorithm, with OOP principles to create an engaging, interactive application. It shows how object-oriented programming can simplify complex problems, providing an organized, efficient solution that is user-friendly. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is utilized in developing Tic-Tac-Toe games using the Minimax Algorithm for game development.
